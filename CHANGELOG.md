# Changelog

All notable changes to ResiCache are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) **with the
pre-1.0 caveat below**.

## Pre-1.0 versioning policy

While the version is `0.x`, **APIs may change in any release — including patch
releases.** Breaking changes are marked with ⚠️ and explained in the release
notes. API stability is only guaranteed from `1.0.0` onward (see the
[Roadmap](README.md#roadmap) in README).

> **Note on the `v1.0` git tag.** A `v1.0` tag exists from an early development
> milestone ("defect remediation complete"). It **does not** denote an API-stable
> or publicly released version — the actual artifact version has always been
> `0.0.x`, and the public 1.0 release is tracked in the Roadmap. The tag is kept
> for history but carries no stability promise.

## [Unreleased] — v0.1.0 (in development)

### Changed
- ⚠️ **BREAKING (safety)** `SyncSupport` no longer **silently degrades** to a
  single-JVM `synchronized` monitor when `sync=true` is declared but no
  distributed lock backend is present (Redisson absent → no `LockManager`
  bean). It now **fails fast** with a clear `IllegalStateException` on the
  first cache miss — single-JVM coordination is useless across instances, and
  "distributed-but-actually-local" is the worst failure mode. A startup
  warning is also logged when the empty-backend condition is detected.
  **Migration:** for explicit single-instance/test degradation, set
  `resi-cache.sync-lock.local-only=true` (emits a
  `protection.degraded=local-only` warning; Observation event lands in v0.2.0).

### Added
- ⚙️ **WS-1.1 FIRE — Spring Boot 4.0 build line (dual-branch)**: ResiCache now
  builds and fully verifies (`verify -Pboot4`, 672 tests + JaCoCo 70%/40% gate)
  on **Boot 4.0 / SDR 4.0 / Spring 7 / Java 21 / Redisson 3.50** on the dedicated
  `boot4` branch, coexisting with the Boot 3.4.x `master` line. SDR 4 / Boot 4
  adaptations: `RedisCacheWriter.remove`→`evict` & `clean`→`clear` (delegating
  impls), `RedisCacheConfiguration.getTtl()`→`getTtlFunction().getTimeToLive(...)`,
  `RedisCacheManager` constructor arg reorder, Boot 4 package relocations
  (`DataRedisAutoConfiguration` / `DataRedisProperties` / `health.contributor`),
  `redisson-spring-boot-starter`→`redisson` core (the starter's auto-config
  hard-references Boot 3 classes), and a defensive `supportsAsyncRetrieve()=false`
  shim (Path C Step 6 will restore it). See [COMPATIBILITY.md](COMPATIBILITY.md)
  dual matrix and `.github/workflows/ci-boot4.yml`.
- `resi-cache.sync-lock.local-only` (default `false`) — explicit opt-in for
  single-JVM sync degradation when no distributed lock backend is available.
- `resi-cache.bloom-filter.rebuild-window-seconds` (default `30`; `0` = disabled) —
  after `@CacheEvict(allEntries=true)` (CLEAN) wipes the Bloom filter, opens a
  per-cacheName **rebuilding window** during which `mightContain` **fails open**
  (returns true), routing requests to the loader instead of silently returning
  null. See the WS-1.2c Fixed entry below.

### Fixed
- **Bloom filter CLEAR rebuilding window (WS-1.2c)**: previously, when
  `@CacheEvict(allEntries=true)` cleared the Bloom filter alongside the cache, the
  empty filter made every subsequent `mightContain` return false, and
  `RedisProCache.get(key, loader)`'s pre-check **silently returned null without
  invoking the loader** — violating the `@Cacheable` contract (a miss should call
  the loader and return the real value). This is a data-correctness defect, not a
  DB breakdown (the loader is never called); it only affects methods with
  `useBloomFilter=true`. `BloomSupport.clear` now opens a per-cacheName rebuilding
  window (Redis-backed flag, TTL = `rebuild-window-seconds`, Cluster-consistent via
  Redis + a 1s local cache) during which `mightContain` fails open, routing
  requests through the normal sync-lock + loader path; the window self-closes via
  Redis TTL. Set `rebuild-window-seconds=0` to restore v0.0.x behavior. Both the
  `RedisProCache.get(key, loader)` path and the chain path
  (`BloomFilterHandler.handleGet`) share `bloomSupport.mightContain`, so both are
  covered by this single-point fix.
- **Redis Cluster distributed lock hash-tag pinning (WS-1.2b)**: in Cluster mode,
  `DistributedLockManager` now ensures the lock key lands in the same slot as the
  cache key (via Redis hash-tag `{...}`), so the lock and the data it guards live
  on the same node and future in-lock MULTI/transactions won't hit cross-slot
  errors. `single`/`sentinel` modes are unchanged; lock-key format is also
  unchanged when the cache key already carries a hash-tag.

## [Unreleased] — planned for v0.0.3

### Added
- `resi-cache.enabled` master kill-switch — the auto-configuration is now gated
  by `@ConditionalOnProperty(prefix = "resi-cache", name = "enabled",
  matchIfMissing = true)`. Set `resi-cache.enabled=false` to fully disable
  ResiCache without removing the dependency.
- **Wildcard `.*` suffix support in `resi-cache.serializer.allowed-package-prefixes`**:
  `WhitelistPolicy.isClassNameAllowed` now matches a trailing `.*` on each prefix
  as a wildcard sentinel (in addition to the existing literal-prefix `startsWith`
  match). `com.example.*` now matches `com.example.Foo`, `com.example.sub.Bar`,
  `com.example.foo.bar.baz.Qux`, etc. (any depth) via the new private helper
  `matchesPrefix(className, prefix)`. Non-wildcard forms keep identical literal
  behavior — `STABILITY.md` §1 (resi-cache.* keys stable) holds, no key added
  or removed. Behavior-class: **additive only** — existing configurations
  behave identically; users adopting `.*` gain capability without affecting
  anyone. Round 9 TDD: 4 new tests in `WhitelistPolicyTest` (3 wildcard + 1
  backward-compat); full verify 673/0/0/0 ✅ (+4 vs Round 5 baseline 669).
  Red-phase correction recorded in the backward-compat test body comment:
  literal `com.example` still matches `com.exampleX.Foo` per `String.startsWith`
  semantics (no dot-boundary enforcement for literal form), since introducing
  it would break existing users — intentionally deferred as a separate decision.
- **`SecureJacksonSerializerFactory` (@Component) extracted** — Round 5 fix had
  to mirror the same 5-arg `SecureJacksonRedisSerializer` constructor across
  three bean assembly sites (`RedisConnectionConfiguration#redisCacheTemplate`,
  `RedisProCacheConfiguration#defaultRedisCacheConfiguration`,
  `TestRedisConfiguration#redisCacheTemplate`). Three sites holding identical
  wiring is a maintenance trap: any ctor-signature edit silently breaks one
  and re-introduces the wired/unwired two-track bug Round 5 just fixed. This
  commit extracts the wiring into a single `@Component` with one
  `create(ObjectMapper, SerializerProperties)` method; both production configs
  inject it. Test twin (`TestRedisConfiguration`) is left as-is since it's a
  `@TestConfiguration` outside the Spring component scan and would actually
  require MORE wiring to use the factory — net simpler to keep it explicit.
  New unit test `SecureJacksonSerializerFactoryTest`: 2 tests including the
  **negative-wiring guard** — explicitly setting
  `allowedPackagePrefixes=["com.example.round11"]` (no `io.github.davidhlp`)
  and roundtripping a `CachedValue` (whose `@class` resolves to
  `io.github.davidhlp...`) must throw `SerializationException` with "whitelist"
  in the message; if the factory silently used defaults instead of the
  configured props, the roundtrip would succeed. This is the regression guard
  for the entire Round 5 + R11 contract. Internal refactor — `STABILITY.md`
  §2 (internals may-change pre-1.0) applies; no public API surface touched.
  Full verify 675/0/0/0 ✅ (+2 vs Round 9 baseline 673). (loop round 11)
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md` requirements + new Maintainers & bus-factor section**:
  (a) Bumped JDK requirement `17+` → `21+` to match `pom.xml
  <java.version>21</java.version>` and the WS-1.1 FIRE cut (Round 8 caught the
  same drift in `.github/workflows/release.yml`; this is the `CONTRIBUTING.md`
  twin — pre-1.0 docs/harness drift between the source manifest and the
  human-facing contributor guide). (b) Added `## Maintainers & bus factor`
  section documenting the current single-maintainer structure honestly (bus
  factor 1) and the implications for `STABILITY.md` §4 graduation criterion #6
  (named successor OR documented succession plan required before 1.0 tag).
  Forward-link to STABILITY makes the graduation gate explicit. Docs-only —
  `STABILITY.md` §2 (docs may-change pre-1.0) applies; §1+§3 not invoked.
  (loop round 12)
- **Composite GitHub Action `.github/actions/setup-jdk-21`** — extracted 6
  `actions/setup-java@v5` calls across 3 workflows (`ci.yml` × 4,
  `pr-checks.yml` × 1, `release.yml` × 1) into a single composite action.
  Eliminates the 6-way drift surface for JDK version + distribution +
  Maven cache config that Round 8 partially fixed in `release.yml` only;
  the composite is now the single source of truth. Defaults pin `java-version:
  '21'` to match `pom.xml <java.version>`; workflow callers override only the
  release-specific `with:` keys (`server-id`, `server-username`,
  `server-password`, `gpg-private-key`, `gpg-passphrase`) — `ci.yml` and
  `pr-checks.yml` need no `with:` at all (defaults suffice). YAML syntax
  validated via PyYAML for all 4 touched files. Pure YAML refactor — no
  secrets, no triggers, no env values changed; `STABILITY.md` §2
  (internals may-change pre-1.0) applies; §1+§3 not invoked.
  (loop round 13)
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md` Releases & CI infrastructure subsection** — new
  guidance pointing future contributors at the composite action
  (`.github/actions/setup-jdk-21/action.yml`) as the JDK source of truth,
  with explicit "JDK bumps must edit only the composite" + "release.yml
  deploy secrets are configured OOB by the maintainer; do not edit
  release.yml to add secrets" guard rails. Helps prevent Round 8/R13-style
  drift if a new contributor comes in and re-adds an inline
  `actions/setup-java@v5` step unaware of the composite structure. The
  reference is the rounding-the-loop of Round 13's refactor: useful on
  its own only if a reader can find it. Docs-only — `STABILITY.md` §2
  (docs may-change pre-1.0) applies; §1+§3 not invoked.
  (loop round 14)
- `resi-cache.protection.enabled` protection-chain switch — when `false`, the
  protection handlers (bloom/lock/early-expiration/null-value) are skipped but
  **TTL is preserved** (TtlHandler also computes the base TTL; disabling it would
  cause permanent caching). Startup-only (chain is cached as a singleton).
- Reactive return-type detection now logs an explicit **"caching will NOT take
  effect"** warning instead of implying a graceful fallback.
- `STABILITY.md`: API stability contract for the pre-1.0 0.x line. Lays out
  what is stable across all 0.x releases (annotations, `resi-cache.*`
  property keys, `{version,payload}` wire format), what may change
  (internals, defaults, package layout, pre-1.0 metric namespace), what
  never changes without a major bump, and the seven 1.0 graduation
  criteria. Required reading before any public API surface change per the
  loop chicken-egg gate.

### Changed
- ⚠️ **BREAKING** `nativeAnnotationMode` default changed from `FULL` →
  **`SELECTIVE`**: plain `@Cacheable` / `@CachePut` / `@CacheEvict` methods are
  now handled entirely by Spring's native cache infrastructure (no longer
  intercepted by ResiCache), which removes the dual-advisor risk. **Migration:**
  if you relied on ResiCache intercepting `@Cacheable`, set
  `resi-cache.native-annotation-mode=FULL` explicitly. Use `@RedisCacheable`
  for protection.
- Whitelist rejection message now includes the remediation property key:
  `resi-cache.serializer.allowed-package-prefixes`. Previously the message
  read "Type not in deserialization whitelist: <class>", leaving users to
  round-trip the docs to discover the property name. Per the
  `COMPETITIVENESS_GUIDE.md` §3 pillar B1 first-contact repair — the most
  common first-key failure no longer requires a doc round-trip.
  Diagnostic message text is classified pre-1.0 "may change" per
  `STABILITY.md` §2 — no public API surface impact.

### Fixed
- Redisson is now a *true* optional dependency: the `RedissonClient` bean and
  all Redisson-specific configuration have been isolated into a dedicated
  configuration class with a class-level `@ConditionalOnClass(RedissonClient.class)`,
  so booting without Redisson on the classpath no longer risks a
  `NoClassDefFoundError`. (`DistributedLockManager` was already class-guarded;
  `SyncSupport` degrades to a JVM-internal monitor when no lock manager is
  present.)
- **`resi-cache.serializer.*` properties were silently dropped by the low-level
  `RedisTemplate<String, Object> redisCacheTemplate` bean** (the one used by
  `RedisProCacheWriter` for direct `opsForValue/HashOperations`). Setting e.g.
  `resi-cache.serializer.allowed-package-prefixes=com.myapp.domain` or
  `resi-cache.serializer.polymorphic-typing-enabled=true` was honored by the
  `@Cacheable` path (production `RedisProCacheConfiguration
  #defaultRedisCacheConfiguration`, lines 63-69) but **not** by the writer
  path → two code paths, two different whitelists, silent inconsistency. The
  bug had been latent since v0.0.1: the bean instantiated
  `new SecureJacksonRedisSerializer(objectMapper)` (no-list ctor = defaults)
  instead of mirroring the 5-arg ctor that takes property values. Fixed by
  injecting `RedisProCacheProperties` and passing `getSerializer()
  .{getAllowedPackagePrefixes, isFailOnUnknownType, getTypeProperty,
  isPolymorphicTypingEnabled}` — same wiring shape as
  `RedisProCacheConfiguration`. Test mirror `TestRedisConfiguration
  #redisCacheTemplate` (`@Primary` IT bean) fixed symmetrically so ITs
  actually verify the production bean. `STABILITY.md` §1 lists
  `resi-cache.*` keys as stable, which implies behavior consistency; this
  fix tightens the contract. Regression test:
  `RedisConnectionConfigurationTest` (Testcontainers, `@DynamicPropertySource`
  sets custom whitelist + polymorphic on, roundtrips a POJO from
  `com.example.round5`, asserts deserialized is the original POJO instance —
  would fail before this fix with "Type not in deserialization whitelist" or
  degrade to `LinkedHashMap` if whitelist alone were honored). TDD: failing
  test → fix → green, full verify 669 tests / 0 failures / 0 skipped.
  (loop round 5)
- **`.github/workflows/release.yml` `JAVA_VERSION` 滞后:** 该工作流曾是
  Java 17 时遗留,`env.JAVA_VERSION: '17'` 没在 WS-1.1 FIRE(commit
  `38c514a`,unify 全栈 Java 21)时被同步,导致 release tag push 时
  `setup-java` 安装 JDK 17,而 `pom.xml` `<java.version>21</java.version>` +
  `maven.compiler.{source,target}=21` 要求 JDK 21 编译,Java 21 语法
  (records / sealed types / pattern matching / switch expressions)在
  JDK 17 编译必失败。`ci.yml` 同 WS-1.1 FIRE 期间已同步到 `'21'`,
  `release.yml` 是遗漏(loop round 8 静态 lint 扫描发现)。修复:`17`→
  `21` + 注释引 WS-1.1 FIRE commit + 解释为何必须对齐 pom.xml。**Only
 改动 `env.JAVA_VERSION` 一行 + 注释**,不动 secret / tag 触发器 /
  `softprops/action-gh-release` 步骤 / 任何 workflow 触发条件(loop §1
  「no outward-facing/irreversible actions: no push / no deploy / no gh
  actions / no tags / no merges」)。本地 commit,不 push;下一次 tag push
  才会真触发该 workflow。STABILITY 不涉及(workflow 配置非 public API
  surface)。

### Documentation alignment
- Reconcile `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` to current versions: Java 21 (was
  "17+"), Spring Boot 4.0.0 (was 3.4.13), Redisson 3.50.0 (was 3.27.0).
  `AGENTS.md` was reduced to a pointer to `CLAUDE.md` because its prior
  full-duplicate had drifted — it still listed the `a5ab55b`-removed
  `wrapper/`/`spi/`/`event/`/`evaluator/`/`CacheMetricsRecorder` and described
  customizability via "Java ServiceLoader" (superseded by Spring
  `@Bean` + `@ConditionalOnMissingBean`). Pointer preserves tool compatibility
  while preventing future drift. (loop round 1)
- **ADR-0006 JetCache 覆盖机制算术修正(事实错误修复)**:原文 Context
  §第 1 段把 TTL jitter 计入 JetCache 覆盖(称"4/5"),与 JetCache 实际能力
  不符。**JetCache Issue #269**(TTL jitter / expiry randomization)状态为
  **closed unimplemented**——维护者判定不予实现。修正为:**3/5 覆盖**

## [0.0.2] — current

### Removed — over-engineering cleanup (commit `a5ab55b`, ~2,989 lines)
⚠️ The following were removed as dead/over-engineered code. They had been
documented in README/CLAUDE.md but never shipped as stable features:

- `wrapper/` — `CircuitBreakerCacheWrapper`, `RateLimiterCacheWrapper`
  (circuit breaking / rate limiting) → use [Resilience4j](https://resilience4j.readthedocs.io/)
- `spi/` package (Java ServiceLoader provider model) — `BloomFilterProvider`,
  `LockProvider`, `RedissonLockProvider`, plus SPI-domain `BloomFilter`,
  `LockHandle`, `LockManager`. Note: only the ServiceLoader SPI package was
  removed — same-named interfaces live on under `protection/breakdown/LockManager`
  and `protection/bloom/filter/BloomIFilter`; customizability is via Spring beans.
- `event/` — `CacheEvictedEvent`
- `evaluator/` — `SpelConditionEvaluator`
- `observability/CacheMetricsRecorder` (only `RedisCacheHealthIndicator` remains)

Customizability is preserved through Spring beans: the strategy implementations
(`BloomIFilter`, `LockManager`) are plain `@Component`s, overridable via your own
`@Bean` + `@ConditionalOnMissingBean` — no Java ServiceLoader.

### Added
- Five protection mechanisms via a composable responsibility chain
  (ordering is a single source of truth in `HandlerOrder`, gap = 100):
  - Bloom filter (100) — penetration
  - Distributed lock (200) — breakdown
  - Early expiration (250) — hot key
  - TTL jitter (300) — avalanche
  - Null value (400) — penetration
- Enhancement annotations: `@RedisCacheable`, `@RedisCachePut`,
  `@RedisCacheEvict`, `@RedisCaching`.
- `SecureJackson` whitelisted deserialization (defense against Jackson
  polymorphic-type attacks) with a `{version, payload}` envelope.
- `RedisCacheHealthIndicator` (actuator health).

### Documentation alignment
README and CLAUDE.md still referenced the removed modules at the time; the LLM
wiki (`wiki/log.md`) records this discrepancy and treats source as the single
source of truth. The README rewrite in this cycle (see Unreleased) closes that
gap.

## [0.0.1] — initial (unpublished)
Initial development. No separate changelog was maintained; superseded by the
0.0.2 cleanup. The artifact version has been `0.0.x` throughout development.
